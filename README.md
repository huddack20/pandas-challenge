Only PyCitySchools is taken into account for pandas challenge. 

Please refer to "PyCitySchools_ChangWoonJang.ipynb". 

This data consists of 15 schools divided into two school types: seven District and eight Charter schools. For the percentage of passing math and reading, charter schools are ranked in the top five schools while five lowest performing schools are all district schools. 

Regardless of grades, the average math and reading scores are not significantly different for all schools. For example, the math score of all grades (9-12th) in Bailery High School is about 77. The reading score in the school is about 80 in all grades. This trend can be observed in all other schools. 

Interestingly, the math and reading scores seem to be lower when the school spending per student is higher. This could result from the school size. Accoring to the school summary, the budget of district schools is much higher than that of charter schools. The smaller the school size is, the higher the percentage of overall math and reading passing is. This could demonstrate that the student-teacher ratio in smaller schools is low and the teachers can provide better quality of teaching to their students.

Overall math and reading passing rate (90.4%) of the charter schools is much higher than that (53.6%) of the district schools. Thus, we could conclude that charter schools provide better quality of education at least for math and reading, drawn from the data, than the district schools in the sense of the student-teacher ratio. 


Additionally, I tried the HerosOfPymoli as well. It ("HeroesOfPymoli_ChangWoonJang.ipynb") perfectly works.
